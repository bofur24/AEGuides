                <strong>Neutral Faction Dungeon Revamp</strong> <br>
                below Hell is the horned one island, a breeding pit of warlike creatures commissioned by the goddess Sabal. The horned creatures, however,
                 refuse to obey the goddess's summons to war. Instead they feast on souls that have lost their way to the spawn gates. Aide the goddess of Chaos and slay these creatures;
                 perhaps you have the courage to take on their scalded leader, Dunkeklinge.

            A non content update here today - though look forward to new content in the next update! This was a big systems change - thank you for your patience. I'm sure there may be other things to iron out with 
            alignment so please share that in the bugs channel.
            <br>
            <strong>===Item/Drops===</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Alignment now being used for player, NPC, name colors and town status rather than faction. Faction quests still available using old rules; faction no longer should limit who you can party, attack, or heal.
                  If something is amiss def let us know. It was a lot of work and we're glad to move on with life. Town takeovers still work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hooks to turn off various features (quests, factions, etc) for server variations
              </li>
              <li>
                Creatures now spawning in a wider radius around you; there will be more creatures in the world now at any given time so we will be monitoring server performance but if you notice UNUSUAL latency please give us a heads up.
                The original restriction was put in place to prevent server running hot. Now that we are in the year 2020, come what may! You will not have mobs spawning on top of you when you run into an inactive chunk.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>===Items===</strong>

              We have been busy with a few very large system changes that were tedious and not terribly interesting to mention; but basically, in order to get the game ready for a new server,
              we had to rebalance all sub 100 weapons as well as retool all of those corresponding drop tables. Mobs will now typically drop items that reflect teir level more accurately.
              Many weapons were removed from drop tables, though a majority of them can still be crafted. Drop rates for lower level mobs have increased (no more .03% chance to get a rapier of the cat).
              Another system change was made to the way randomness was seeded (maybe Zarq will elaborate if you are to ask him...).
              <br>
              I would also like to announce that we will be officially RETIRING the Heilige Lance from drop tables. It is no longer dropping from any monster in game; therefore, if you have them, consider them to be 
              a commodity which will not be coming back! Measuring cups have also been removed; an innocuous item that was useless, but hey, you can put them on your shelf and let them catch dust if you have them.
              Look for future patches to retire and introduce gear to keep things interesting! And Finally...though many of your changes to date have been to clean up the game and the new Quest window and Leadership systems,
              for all the 105+ players... hearken thine ears!!!
              <br>
              Zule has long awaited a chance to strike back at the many enemies that stalk his lair! Drawing on an ancient power found deep in the mine, he has trained a force of warriors to repel invaders that want to lay claim
              to his treasure horde... 
              <br>
              Enjoy a new challenging adventure there and among other ToF giantkin...

              This was added a few patches ago and I am not sure why I didn't include in notes; you can make Large Crab Stew. 
              The reciped is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>2 Crab Meat</li>
                <li>1 Potatoes</li>
                <li>1 Carrots</li>
                <li>1 Milk</li>
              </ul>
              It may not make sense sometimes why we're working on what we are, but there are many systems to learn and it has been good to work briefly in each of them.
              Cooking for example, is obviously not at the fore front of anyone's mind when it comes to what is needed to be done; however, it was a good suggestion, easy,
              and a good opportunity to learn.
