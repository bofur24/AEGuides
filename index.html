                We are hearing some reports of the UI resetting instead of converting. Our apologies if this impacts you. We tested this thoroughly with dozens of players multiple times but there must be some scenarios we weren't able to reprogram.

                The Steam Update
              </p> 
              <p>
                It’s Christmas in August September!! Thanks for sticking with us over the last 4 years and showing your support through many hours logged, being active on Discord, and purchasing dem tonks.
                 This update has a lot of changes with Steam update in mind – new features, a smoother leveling experience, and automated token purchasing, to name a few. 
                 Below are the changes in this patch; there are many new features, changes and balance adjustments - especially regarding alignment on the rules for the new server Ascension. 
                 Read more for what’s new in this build. As always…good luck, and happy hunting!! 😉
              </p>
              ===System Changes===
              <ul>
                <li>Pixel Mine Launcher is NO LONGER functional. Use STEAM to launch the games (you are given 5 chances upon launching game to bind to our system, so know your account info please!) </li>
                <li>Secure.pixelminegames.com will NO LONGER be functional. When we are done with migration, please use CUSTOMER.IRONWILLGAMES.COM (login through steam)</li>
                <li>Bug report in game will direct to tickets</li>
                <li>Payments are now launched from the game store, and completed in Steam. We cannot assist you with Steam payments.</li>
              </ul>
              ===New Features===
              <ul>
                <li>New combat target reticule</li>
                <li>Improved GUI saving/loading</li>
                <li>Snap to Windows</li>
                <li>Cast buffs/heals in Party Window</li>
                <li>Changed from DirectDraw to Direct3D graphics engine </li>
                <li>Server Select screen grid instead of hard-coded art icons</li>
                <li>Drop to destroy now disabled except for NO DROP items; when dropping an item on ground, you will not receive a warning message unless it’s a NO DROP item. All items will be placed on ground and cleaned up by the server every ~10 min or so.</li>
                <li>Trash Barrels – placed near banks in most cities. Trash around barrel to denote their function. Once used, anything inside is consumed/destroyed. To assist in quick removal of items. This is my finest accomplishment. If only I could put myself into it.</li>
                <li>Ability for designers to disable taskmasters per server</li>
              </ul>
              ===Zoning/Alignment===
              <ul>
                <li>Majority of Krog/Silvest/Whisperdale areas are now safe zones. This extends to an obvious physical barrier such as a river crossing or mountain pass/choke. In Silvest, this is at the guard gate before going to Varg. In Krog, this is at the river crossing on the way to Dawat/VF. In Whisperdale, it is the river crossing just before Darkfell and the mountain pass near Ewwww’s lair. Below ground areas accessible there also safe zones. This extends to all servers where safe zones are enabled (H/L/Ascension). As patron saint of newbs everywhere, I give my blessing to these areas.</li>
                <li> Majority of cities changed to Divine (white) alignment from Neutral (yellow). Alignment will be more useful moving forward. PLEASE be careful when logging in if you are evil or worse (orange/red names)
                  <ul>
                    <li>Evil Cities: LOPAL, MEROVEN, GRELL, DARUSHK, SYLDURAL, DESPRAIL, RAHURA, REDWAKE</li>

                    <li>Divine Cities: All other not here named</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Ability for designers to set alignment gain chance per server to assist in making alignment more useful (H/L unchanged, A server will have random chance to gain alignment per kill)</li>
                <li>Ability for designers to set backpack drop based on alignment to assist in making alignment more useful (H/L unchanged, A server will have reduced chance to drop backpack for players with better reputation)</li>
              </ul>
              ===More Alignment===
              <ul>
                <li>Killing neutral or better NPCs will lower your reputation</li>
                <li>Evil or worse players have options for various NPCs that are found in LSP in the evil cities of Lopal/Redwake:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Lopal: TMs, VIP Soulstone </li>
                    <li>Rahura: Construction sales, Advanced Skills Trainer</li>
                    <li>Redwake: Dark Steward (city align reset), Henchmen and Familiar trainers, ToF raft offer, VIP Store </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Where enabled, good or better players do not take reputation loss for killing evil or worse reputation player</li>
                <li>Killing another player will result in a loss of reputation (varying per server)</li>
                <li>Death as an evil or worse player when NOT wanted will send you to a crim spawn gate</li>
                <li>VIP Soulstone will send to Lopal tavern instead of LSP if you are evil or worse</li>
              </ul>

                Patch Notes
              </p> 
              <p>
                This is primarily a pre-Steam patch to address some polish level fixes in low level content/quests. For those that are wondering how that is going outside of content/polish fixes - our Steam client is in closed beta testing; it has some enhancements such as snap to windows, updated directx draw/optimization, fixes for UI config saving, party window healing/buffs. That will be available with Steam which we plan to launch later this summer (date TBD).
              </p>

               Patch Notes 
              </p>
              <p>
                Event adjusts plus some bugs that got squashed. Notably, Jeel/Hothbra no longer included in event driven sieges. The altar driven Demon Spires spawn further away from towns, of which is a new one (Parian). They should no longer keep the native event spawn from happening, however, if an event spire is up when you start a siege it will spawn the mobs of the event spire town. I sacrificed this possibility for the sake of getting the patch out there since this is a limited time event. I did NOT change drop rates, nor will I reveal the hidden nature of the method for obtaining the Ghost Ship. You who have asked should quit AE and go to Law School. You have a missed calling!
              </p> 
                ===Item Adjusts===
                <ul>

                  <li>Fate of Giants special now looks at creature type, should function on all marked as giants</li>

                </ul>

                ===Quest===
                <ul>
                  <li>Bug with Treba quest - old quest data got messed up, added a check for anyone with data of 5-8 to be able to complete quest</li>
                  <li>Sailor's Bet quest misspelled (Sailor instead of Sailer)</li>
                  <li>Warlord Archer/Mage quest exp not boosted like warrior's</li>
                  <li>Fixed invalid gold reward on Valinor mage trainer quests</li>

              <p>
                Patch today to adjust the Hell Siege event probably for the last time (hopefully). This includes a few more new items to enjoy. The idea here was to make the creatures feel more rewarding and take the edge off their difficulty slightly. It is still a challenging event, weapons are still going to be rare, but overall event should be more doable for more players.
              </p> 
                ===New Items===
                <ul>
                  <li>Wicked Dice (roll the dice to be rewarded a random item; note that there are some unique items that can only be gotten this way!!!)</li>
                  <li>Aspect of the Minion (the og model)</li>
                  <li>Evil's Accomplice (a dagger which summons a Wretched Follower, styled after Ancient Follower with some modifications to damage and dot type)</li>
                  <li>Spire Stone (a teleport which takes you to the runespire in Hell, degrades on use)</li>
                  <li>Deed - Ghost Ship (this has been in for some time but unavailable. and no please do not ask me what drops it!)</li>
                </ul>
                ===Adjusts===
                <ul>
                  <li>Balron/Demon difficulty reduced slightly</li>
                  <li>Demon Spires moved out of town a little bit more to reduce dropping and wanted status from guards accidentally happening - or not accidentally happening if you are in a pvp situation)</li>
                  <li>Reduced # of Balrons/Demons which spawn in town sieges and moved them</li>
                  <li>Adjust to drop tables of Spire, Ancient Balron/Demon</li>
                  <li>Added light spawn of ancient mobs to badlands cave. Put your floaties on, this is meant to be a gentler experience. Note: You obtain access through Enderic, a roguish looking quest NPC outside of Chlera.</li>
                  <li>Health of Totem of Siege has been adjusted to 100 from 20. It is designed to degrade - please keep that in mind. Item Degrade is currently disabled but will be re-enabled with event changes in this patch.</li>
                  <li>Added some extra security to the entrance to hell. Please do not leave chars in to monitor locations. This was stated previously in my announcement. I kinda meant it. My feels are hurt that you disregarded my warnings, now your turn to be hurt 🥲 </li>
                  <li>Spire chance to spawn reduced slightly. They are not meant to be the sole encounter to hunt. Everything, including vendors, have unique items so you will have to play it all.</li>
                  <li>Ancient Demons/Balrons have a new particle effect to distinguish them from normal mobs. You will need to have particles turned on to see this difference.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If you purchased a totem of siege and the health is 20 or less after patch, please let me know and I will fix it up for you. Thank you.

              <p>
                Adjusted the chance for a spire to spawn from the system. Please let me know if it is a little better after a day or so. Keep in mind that spawning spire from altar will impact this spawn chance. Thanks!

                <li>Bumped spire spawn chance slightly</li>

                Agriculture Update
              </p>
              <p>
                Today’s update is the first of many updates to our crafting system – grab your shovel and get dirty! Even if you have maxed Planting, Foraging, (and Harvesting?? You psycho!) you can still enjoy playing through a new quest line which takes you on a journey across the lands of Dransik, starting in Silvest and traveling through many areas of Mainlands with a stop at each expansion! Help save the kingdom with the power of 🌿  P L A N T S! 🌿 I had a great time writing this quest line and hope you enjoy it as well!
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the quest line, which features some unique new items for farming (and a few just for fun!), we got our hands dirty and retooled the progression for farming and foraging. Here is an overview of the changes:
              </p>
              ===Agriculture===
              <ul>
                <li>Greater experience for planting seeds vs fruits (and updated exp on planting depending on difficulty; more difficult seeds/crops give more experience)</li>
                <li>Grow more crops using fertilizer! To make fertilizer, start with an empty bucket. Add to it ground shells or bones. Use certain bones, triddle shells and various other insect shells in a mill to grind them (list of items that can make bone meal will be expanded in future, currently skeletal skulls and skeleton pirate fragments). Plant this and dig up your fertilizer! Using it on freshly planted seeds will increase your base yield! Try to add more things to the slop to make it richer!</li>
                <li>Increased resale value of crops (need some gold? Get digging!)</li>
                <li>Cash Crops: Chance to grow some cash crops which sell for more than normal: Barrel of Apples, Prize Tomato, and the rare White or Black rose.</li>
                <li>New items which decrease digging time or decrease planting time</li>
                <li> Certain growing conditions favor different crops: Some crops grow more quickly in certain parts of the world</li>
                <li>NEW RESOURCE: Wild Mushrooms and Mushroom Steaks (requires level 45 to harvest Wild Mushrooms, 55 to forage for Raw Mushroom Steaks)</li>
              </ul>
              ===The Farming Quest===
              <ul>
                <li>The quests start with an NPC named Stratton in the Silvest Farm shop. You must progress through this entire questline and the ones following to reach the “Master” quest. NOTE: This is NOT the “master of all” quest. So do not think you have to get 2500 kills in each category (though maybe it’s not a bad idea to work on that anyways hmm? 😉  ). Even if you "hate quests and tradeskills" I hope you check it out!</li>
                <li>There are 25 quests in this entire quest line</li>
                <li>Some lovely rewards await those who are able to complete it!</li>
                <li>Most quests involve growing something, killing something, and looking for something. If you get stuck, go talk to the NPC!</li>
              </ul>
              ===Other Changes (it's a really big junk drawer)
              <ul>
                <li>Check out the newly revamped Amnon Vre dungeon!</li>
                <li>A new low level dungeon near Whisperdale – the Marsh Dungeon! This was a collaborative effort between my son and I. Speak to NPC Legrant on the south side of Whisperdale to start this quest to access this dungeon!</li>
                <li>Patrons now reward well up to level 50 (then xp drops off; previous was 43)</li>
                <li>Added randomness to lich prince's timer</li>
                <li>Typo in crystal orb quest</li>
                <li>Adjust to Runic Priest spells</li>
                <li>Small text adjust on Addie's text when she gives wine recipe</li>
                <li>Dolas fern now requires level 35 instead of 45 to forage</li>
                <li>Adjust to Mnemnon spawn - added small skeles, reduced chance on undead priest level 55 encounter</li>
                <li>Adjusted zebra skinning quest to require only level 45</li>
                <li>Fix for faction req to enter crim gate under BFD</li>
                <li>Fix for Mage Trainer quest - Treba npc quest now branched to show which creature type to kill</li>
                <li>Removed degrade on tradeskill tools for new players</li>
                <li>Added Check for Remedy so it can't be immediately recast</li>
                <li>Adjust to Tyrian set stats (inc DEX/INT, + SOUL, varying resist additions/changes)</li>
                <li>Beekeeper set stat adjust (level orb reqs down, added stats, harvesting bonus)</li>
                <li>Ghost of Lotor resists updated</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This was a long 5 months and there could be a few other small changes which slipped by but if I discover them I will update this list.

                The mage update!
               </p>
               <p>
                Included in today’s patch is an updated spell book with more information about each spell including a description and targeting options. All spells were reviewed for progression/balance/utility. Please see notes below for details.
               </p>
               <p>
                After you’re done exploring changes to spells, get ready to head to the frozen lands in the Talazar’s Revenge expansion for a holiday event! The Christmas Grinch has turned hard working Snow Elves and Reindeer into evil, lazy creatures – but not all is lost! You can hunt them for gifts, or try to melt the Grinch’s frozen heart and gain his treasure! Beware his helpers...
               </p>
               <p>
                Note: The Holiday Event is a high level event. Angry Snowmen are still a low/mid level mob, but they do not drop special holiday prizes. It will be open Dec 20th through Jan 1st.

              <p>
                Be advised, the Greater Dragon cave entrance is now functioning, so unless you have quest update you will not be able to enter it. It is a repeatable quest, if you have chosen to repeat it to get another ring 
                you have to get the update again to gain access. I will not be able to correct that until a future patch. Thank you.

                A longstanding issue with creatures spawning in the dungeon map has been fixed! Itcaused spawn issues on the underground cave systems; over time creatures would spawn into the black portions of the map and slowly empty the area of killable spawns.
                Please leave feedback on caves - and be careful, as some might be more difficult than they previously were.
              </p>

                <li>
                  King of Krythan Event - this event will run throughout Season 3 Chaos. While killing monsters, you have a chance to be crowned the King of Krythan! There is only one King, and all players can see the King on their map.
                  While king you can go beyond the 50K chaos point cap and receive triple points. You will receive a legendary King's Crown and King's blade with deadly DPS and a special effect. King statu lasts 20 minutes, or until you die or log out.
                  The King's Blade is a rune slot large blade with no skill requirement and a hefty buff of +100 to all orbs and +500 HP. It's good to be the King!

              ===Map===
              <ul>

                <li>Spawn Increase Altar (Evil altar of Offering in Meroven) now has a 1 hour cooldown to use following the end of a spawn increase. we will look at adjusting spawns in encounters to help smooth out gameplay experience, until then, we hope this and the dungeon spawning fix will help even out the play experience for everyone.</li>
                <li>Icebane got tired of adventurer's eves-dropping on him and did a little rearranging in the 'ol lair.</li>

                  Totem of Sabal's Children followers have been adjusted to circumvent abuse of their innate 100% resistances. All sabal followers now have a static 65% damage reduction, and health modifier was changed to accommodate a similar toghness. This has come at a slight cost in their DPS output. In addition, special abilities have been removed from the 
                  Marrowsucker to prevent abuse of berserk and theBone crusher becasue he would sometimes get caught in a loop trying to cast root continuously.

                <strong>Neutral Faction Dungeon Revamp</strong> <br>
                below Hell is the horned one island, a breeding pit of warlike creatures commissioned by the goddess Sabal. The horned creatures, however,
                 refuse to obey the goddess's summons to war. Instead they feast on souls that have lost their way to the spawn gates. Aide the goddess of Chaos and slay these creatures;
                 perhaps you have the courage to take on their scalded leader, Dunkeklinge.

            A non content update here today - though look forward to new content in the next update! This was a big systems change - thank you for your patience. I'm sure there may be other things to iron out with 
            alignment so please share that in the bugs channel.
            <br>
            <strong>===Item/Drops===</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Alignment now being used for player, NPC, name colors and town status rather than faction. Faction quests still available using old rules; faction no longer should limit who you can party, attack, or heal.
                  If something is amiss def let us know. It was a lot of work and we're glad to move on with life. Town takeovers still work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hooks to turn off various features (quests, factions, etc) for server variations

              <li>
                Creatures now spawning in a wider radius around you; there will be more creatures in the world now at any given time so we will be monitoring server performance but if you notice UNUSUAL latency please give us a heads up.
                The original restriction was put in place to prevent server running hot. Now that we are in the year 2020, come what may! You will not have mobs spawning on top of you when you run into an inactive chunk.

              We have been busy with a few very large system changes that were tedious and not terribly interesting to mention; but basically, in order to get the game ready for a new server,
              we had to rebalance all sub 100 weapons as well as retool all of those corresponding drop tables. Mobs will now typically drop items that reflect teir level more accurately.
              Many weapons were removed from drop tables, though a majority of them can still be crafted. Drop rates for lower level mobs have increased (no more .03% chance to get a rapier of the cat).
              Another system change was made to the way randomness was seeded (maybe Zarq will elaborate if you are to ask him...).
              <br>
              I would also like to announce that we will be officially RETIRING the Heilige Lance from drop tables. It is no longer dropping from any monster in game; therefore, if you have them, consider them to be 
              a commodity which will not be coming back! Measuring cups have also been removed; an innocuous item that was useless, but hey, you can put them on your shelf and let them catch dust if you have them.
              Look for future patches to retire and introduce gear to keep things interesting! And Finally...though many of your changes to date have been to clean up the game and the new Quest window and Leadership systems,
              for all the 105+ players... hearken thine ears!!!
              <br>
              Zule has long awaited a chance to strike back at the many enemies that stalk his lair! Drawing on an ancient power found deep in the mine, he has trained a force of warriors to repel invaders that want to lay claim
              to his treasure horde... 
              <br>
              Enjoy a new challenging adventure there and among other ToF giantkin...

              This was added a few patches ago and I am not sure why I didn't include in notes; you can make Large Crab Stew. 
              The reciped is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>2 Crab Meat</li>
                <li>1 Potatoes</li>
                <li>1 Carrots</li>
                <li>1 Milk</li>
              </ul>
              It may not make sense sometimes why we're working on what we are, but there are many systems to learn and it has been good to work briefly in each of them.
              Cooking for example, is obviously not at the fore front of anyone's mind when it comes to what is needed to be done; however, it was a good suggestion, easy,
              and a good opportunity to learn.
