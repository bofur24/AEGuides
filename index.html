                A longstanding issue with creatures spawning in the dungeon map has been fixed! Itcaused spawn issues on the underground cave systems; over time creatures would spawn into the black portions of the map and slowly empty the area of killable spawns.
                Please leave feedback on caves - and be careful, as some might be more difficult than they previously were.
              </p>
              ===Weapon/Armor===
              <ul>
                <li>Slight DPS adjust on Symboled blade of Destruction (down)</li>
                <li>Shield of the Sun CON req now 30 (down from 60)</li>
              </ul>           
              ===Even===
              <ul>
                <li>
                  King of Krythan Event - this event will run throughout Season 3 Chaos. While killing monsters, you have a chance to be crowned the King of Krythan! There is only one King, and all players can see the King on their map.
                  While king you can go beyond the 50K chaos point cap and receive triple points. You will receive a legendary King's Crown and King's blade with deadly DPS and a special effect. King statu lasts 20 minutes, or until you die or log out.
                  The King's Blade is a rune slot large blade with no skill requirement and a hefty buff of +100 to all orbs and +500 HP. It's good to be the King!
                </li>
              </ul>
              ===Map===
              <ul>
                <li>Increased spawn of buoys throughout the world and added some more buoy spawn points; shortened respawn timer slightly on all buoys.</li>
                <li>The Dark Alchemist Droawan in Desprail is now a functioning shop and not just a dapper looking but evil hearted gentleman</li>
                <li>New High level Swamp area <<< of New Korelth off of the coast of Krythan Island</li>
                <li>Power Hour Altar (Good altar of Offering in Teylan) now costs half as much (in item coast)</li>
                <li>Spawn Increase Altar (Evil altar of Offering in Meroven) now has a 1 hour cooldown to use following the end of a spawn increase. we will look at adjusting spawns in encounters to help smooth out gameplay experience, until then, we hope this and the dungeon spawning fix will help even out the play experience for everyone.</li>
                <li>Icebane got tired of adventurer's eves-dropping on him and did a little rearranging in the 'ol lair.</li>
                <li>LSP Portals on L no longer require cooldown to use.</li>
              </ul>
              ===Monsters===
              <ul>
                <li>Creatures should no longer spawn in the void; please share feedback on spawns as there were too many to individually test and we can adjust as necessary. Thank you</li>
                <li>Adjusted spawn timere and drop tables for dungeon minibosses Der Schlaechter and Krank Brut. Extra kranky!</li>
                <li>Adjusted spawn timer for Lotorian Crypt minibosses (Volsey, Lancel, Hobernsrnosfjskdjfkldsajorl)</li>
                <li>
                  Totem of Sabal's Children followers have been adjusted to circumvent abuse of their innate 100% resistances. All sabal followers now have a static 65% damage reduction, and health modifier was changed to accommodate a similar toghness. This has come at a slight cost in their DPS output. In addition, special abilities have been removed from the 
                  Marrowsucker to prevent abuse of berserk and theBone crusher becasue he would sometimes get caught in a loop trying to cast root continuously.
                </li>                
              </ul>
              ===Shop===
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Henchman store item has been updated and improved. this is a 10 token rental for 6 hours that will give you a level appropriate follower. You will also receive a totem which you can use to quickly resummons them from anywhere in the world if thye suffer an unfortunate accident on the job (please don;t ball OSHA).
                  Please speak to the Henchman trainer in LSP (south of the bank & west of the LSP Farm) to start your henchman timer and receive a totem.
                </li>

              </ul>
              ===Chaos==
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Demon Spires will now spawn regularly throughout Krythan Island and Hell on Chaos only. These are high level encounters that will spawn difficult mobs as you chip away at the spire. Any players on the spire's hat elist will receive treasures randomly, in similar way to the Knight of Talazar.
                  This is designed to be a PVP focal point as they reliably drop high level gear, including Rune items, when killed.
                </li>
                <li>A merchant from far away has unloaded hi pack horse on a secluded island in Mainlands, selling valuable commodities such as Blood Bandges, Crates, Malacinth, pie and rare and valuable potions for gold. A fee of 25k gold is required to ener. (Chaos Only)</li>

                balance details that seem unfinished, that is why. Thanks for understanding! We'd rather have a few visual things and inconveniences than players lose items/time.

                <strong>Neutral Faction Dungeon Revamp</strong> <br>
                below Hell is the horned one island, a breeding pit of warlike creatures commissioned by the goddess Sabal. The horned creatures, however,
                 refuse to obey the goddess's summons to war. Instead they feast on souls that have lost their way to the spawn gates. Aide the goddess of Chaos and slay these creatures;
                 perhaps you have the courage to take on their scalded leader, Dunkeklinge.

            A non content update here today - though look forward to new content in the next update! This was a big systems change - thank you for your patience. I'm sure there may be other things to iron out with 
            alignment so please share that in the bugs channel.
            <br>
            <strong>===Item/Drops===</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Alignment now being used for player, NPC, name colors and town status rather than faction. Faction quests still available using old rules; faction no longer should limit who you can party, attack, or heal.
                  If something is amiss def let us know. It was a lot of work and we're glad to move on with life. Town takeovers still work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hooks to turn off various features (quests, factions, etc) for server variations

                Creatures now spawning in a wider radius around you; there will be more creatures in the world now at any given time so we will be monitoring server performance but if you notice UNUSUAL latency please give us a heads up.
                The original restriction was put in place to prevent server running hot. Now that we are in the year 2020, come what may! You will not have mobs spawning on top of you when you run into an inactive chunk.

              We have been busy with a few very large system changes that were tedious and not terribly interesting to mention; but basically, in order to get the game ready for a new server,
              we had to rebalance all sub 100 weapons as well as retool all of those corresponding drop tables. Mobs will now typically drop items that reflect teir level more accurately.
              Many weapons were removed from drop tables, though a majority of them can still be crafted. Drop rates for lower level mobs have increased (no more .03% chance to get a rapier of the cat).
              Another system change was made to the way randomness was seeded (maybe Zarq will elaborate if you are to ask him...).
              <br>
              I would also like to announce that we will be officially RETIRING the Heilige Lance from drop tables. It is no longer dropping from any monster in game; therefore, if you have them, consider them to be 
              a commodity which will not be coming back! Measuring cups have also been removed; an innocuous item that was useless, but hey, you can put them on your shelf and let them catch dust if you have them.
              Look for future patches to retire and introduce gear to keep things interesting! And Finally...though many of your changes to date have been to clean up the game and the new Quest window and Leadership systems,
              for all the 105+ players... hearken thine ears!!!
              <br>
              Zule has long awaited a chance to strike back at the many enemies that stalk his lair! Drawing on an ancient power found deep in the mine, he has trained a force of warriors to repel invaders that want to lay claim
              to his treasure horde... 
              <br>
              Enjoy a new challenging adventure there and among other ToF giantkin...

              This was added a few patches ago and I am not sure why I didn't include in notes; you can make Large Crab Stew. 
              The reciped is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>2 Crab Meat</li>
                <li>1 Potatoes</li>
                <li>1 Carrots</li>
                <li>1 Milk</li>
              </ul>
              It may not make sense sometimes why we're working on what we are, but there are many systems to learn and it has been good to work briefly in each of them.
              Cooking for example, is obviously not at the fore front of anyone's mind when it comes to what is needed to be done; however, it was a good suggestion, easy,
              and a good opportunity to learn.
