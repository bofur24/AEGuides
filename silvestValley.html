                        I can tell by the gleam in thine eye that ye've had a run in with the sneaks! Cowards, the whole breed. When ye cut one down, five more appear! If ye should attack the kobold fort, though, t'would put the fear of man in them. <span class="orange">He leans in</span> Oh, aye, there is another way in... 
                        Seek out the Silvest Mines... inside the windy caverns is a path which will take ye underneath the kobold fort. Head east inside the caverns and you shall surely find the way, though the path is hidden by secret walls... and if ye go that way, perhaps yed like to help me with a little Kobold problem?
                        Once the deed is done, I will bestow an item from my treasury. I managed to escape with these few things... but I will gladly give them away for a chance to be back in my home! at the center of the fort, in the old dining hall once aglow with laughter, and feasts, and stories of old... 
                        Alas! To speak of these happy days increases my pain... now there lives a pompous old wretch which calls itself the Kobold King. Slay it and I will reward thee! Very good a seasoned warrior as theyself might find it an even match. still... be cautious. 'Tis a crafty evil behind that door!

                        You alone must find the answers to your questions. Do not rely on the so-called wisdom of others! Consider these tomes of knowledge stored in Aelfwyn's hold.
                        They did not save use from the Rune War. While the battle raged above, I pored over them to find an answer to stop the evil... in the end, we still do not know what drove them from our lands.
                        T'would have been better if I had gone above and risked my life to save the one I loved... And so I continue my studies. I hope to find a way to return her from undeath. But you - you can still choose a different path.
                        Remember this lesson as you seek the answers to your questions.

                      You must be cautious. Do not run ahead in foolishness, thinking you are as strong as the rest. You're not. now then..hmm...something to do..Ah yes. Why don't you use that nasty little wand on the Thieves that roam these forests. They pickpocketed a valuable item from me.

                      I sulked about town for a few weeks, then got bored. I tanned a ew skins. Skinned a few hides. Hid a few skins of wine in new hides. Got bored of that. Drank under the stars with the firefly swarms... I wandered about Krythan many, many years. Cliffside is now my home.

                        Speak to <span class="light-red">Kerrigon the Dark</span>. I will not be questioned by the likes of you today. You wish to be trained in Soul Magic; that is all I need to know. Soul magic tethers the world together. It binds our incorporeal frames.
                        It also tears through flesh to find the substance behind; to mend or to melt... The soul of some is stronger than others; these undead that roam our lands had week, pathetic souls wich were harvested by Talazar to wreck evil. We shall find out if you possess a string enough soul... 
                        Take this hollowed wand. Fill it with the souls of the undead.
