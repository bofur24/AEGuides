It's mostly due to the Lizardman stronghold on the coast. Could you please go to him?
                        Just follow the coast north from Whisperdale. Go past the Lizardmen until you find a dock. You will find him there. His name is Old Gerald. Please help him.

Hello sir, or is it Lady? I can't qite tell... Well no matter. Have you come here to fish? Good luck! I haven't had a bite in ages. Those stinkin Lizardmen are eating all the fish. I moved to this area to enjoy the peace and quiet.
                        And now I have to deal with those scale covered Muckstompers. Say, could you go and rough up their dwelling? Scare them out of the place so I can fish again. Tere should be 5 Lizardmen Totems located down there. I had a chance to go there and deface 10 of them already. I just need help finishing the task. <span class="light-green">Consider it done, I hate those lizards too!</span>

                      Return to the shelter and speak to <span class="light-red">Captain Laulban</span>, So, you're the new recruit, eh? Very well.<span class="light-green"> What are my duties?</span> Your duties here are simple. The supplies and records in these chambers have been stored for the Astari people in case of an emergency, such as a second Rune War.
                      Our job is to protect them. We've been facing an infestation of poisonous green triddles lately. They come up through a trap door, way in the back of the shelter. Not the one just west of here - that goes down to the sewers. We're not sure where the one in the back leads. The vermin can't get in if the trap door stays closed, but some of these recruits are.. shall we say... forgetful.
                      So every once in a while the triddles get in and go after the supp,ies. And evey once in a while one of the recruits doesn't come back. We have to keep the trap door closed, and that is your first assignment. Follow this corridor to its end. The trap door is in the last room. Exterminate any insects that have come through. Be sure to check the lock on the trap door, and clse it if it's open. Then report back to me.

                      Go out and around to the south of the Captains office all the way to the west to the last door. There should be a few insects running around in the hallway.<span class="red"> Spiders, or Green Triddles.</span> Kill them then enter the room and close the trap door in the floor. You will be updated again.

                      <br>
                      I'm glad to see you back in on piece, recruit. What do you have to report? <span class="light-green">I found the trapdoor. It was open, so I closed it.</span> Good work. I'm glad to see that you can handle yourself, soldier. I have another assignment for you; Lord Malgoth over in Dunmarrow has asked us to send him certain documents from our files. Apparently, this shelter held the last remaining copy. I sent your predecessor to get them 
                      , but like so many others, he never returned. The documents are filed away in a foot chest, in the room just before the one where the triddles are getting in. Go find these papers and bring them to me. But be careful - there may still be some insects about. <span class="light-green">Dunmarrow? Where's that?</span> Dunmarrow is an ancient Astari city, beyond the river to the east. They say it survived the ravages of the Rune War because 
                      of a blessing from the goddess Ulthien. I'm afraid I don't know the full story. Anyway, Lord Malgoth's request is legitimate if that's what you're concerned about. Now go.

                      By the scars of Arna! Missing you say? I know what must have happened. As I told you, the recruits we've lost have been disappearing completely. The insects must be dragging them down, through that accursed trap door, to their lair. If I'm to send Lord Malgoth his papers I need a brave and resourceful soldier to go down there and find them. You are the best I've got. Prepare carefully, and feel free to recruit others to help - we don't know what's down there. Find those documents and bring them back to me. Good luck, soldier!

                      <br>
                      Return to Captain Laulban. Excellent work! I'll have a runner carry these to Lord Malgoth in Dunmarrow immediately. I'm astounded by your account of the tunnel complex that lies beneath us. I'll be writing to Lord Solfein, explaining our need for even more new recruits. You, on the other hand, are too important to be wasted on guard duty. Any recruit off the street can guard these supplies. Very few can brave the perils you have faced. Effective immediately, I'm promoting you to Lieutenant and mustering you out of the Astari Guard.
                       With your promotion, you've earned The Sash of the Astari Guard. Wear it proudly! Here is your pay. Thanks again Lieutenant, and good luck!

Learning to properly fire a crossbow takes diligence and self-discipline. They might attack slower, but with a precise shot, you can do a tremendous amount of damage to perfect your aim, slay a great number of Termigon Workers with this Splinterwood Small Crossbow.
                        Do not rush... you cannot expect good results from sloppy work.
