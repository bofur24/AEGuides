                        <span class="light-red">Legrant:</span> We elves had no business digging in the first place!! Our home is in the trees, in beautifully crafted bows and fine things that make no noise when you slip through the woods... I blather on... The crystal is an object of small power...nothing to attract the Rune Warriors to this palce.
                        However, it could be used to fortify the walls of Whisperdale and bring greater peace to the Darkwoods. We began digging, and unearthed a chamber sealed long ago. perhaps sealed by the founders of this great city! Then the marsh lights followed us... Somehow or other, they found the crystal before us. That is when our troubles began.

                        <span class="light-red">Legrant:</span> One of the marsh lights must have absorbed the energy from the crystal. It grew in size and power. We call it Baneshine. Many other strange lights can be seen at times - and the most terrible sounds one can imagine! I hope that oneday Lotor will send a great warrior to help us recover the crystal and subdue the evil creatures that have made it their home.
                        in fact, when I saw you I thought you had potential.

My hands were shaking. If you find that Great Light, maybe you can get the boot back. Marsh Lights are drawn to shiny objects. I bet it is playing with it. I can't go back to Owyn without it. He'll be so angry with me.

                        And now I have to deal with those scale covered Muckstompers. Say, could you go and rough up their dwelling? Scare them out of the place so I can fish again. There should be 5 Lizardmen Totems located down there. I had a chance to go there and deface 10 of them already. I just need help finishing the task.

                      Our job is to protect them. We've been facing an infestation of poisonous green triddles lately. They come up through a trap door, way in the back of the shelter. Not the one just west of here - that goes down to the sewers. We're not sure where the one in the back leads. The vermin can't get in if the trap door stays closed, but some of these recruits are.. shall we say... forgetful.
                      So every once in a while the triddles get in and go after the suppies. And evey once in a while, one of the recruits doesn't come back. We have to keep the trap door closed, and that is your first assignment. Follow this corridor to its end. The trap door is in the last room. Exterminate any insects that have come through. Be sure to check the lock on the trap door, and close it if it's open. Then report back to me.

I have another assignment for you; Lord Malgoth over in Dunmarrow has asked us to send him certain documents from our files. Apparently, this shelter held the last remaining copy. I sent your predecessor to get them 
                      , but like so many others, he never returned. The documents are filed away in a foot chest, in the room just before the one where the triddles are getting in. Go find these papers and bring them to me. But be careful - there may still be some insects about.

                      of a blessing from the goddess Ulthien. I'm afraid I don't know the full story. Anyway, Lord Malgoth's request is legitimate if that's what you're concerned about. Now go.
